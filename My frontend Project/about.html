                <h2>Our Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Founded in 2022, Ambydates started as a family project to share the taste of the Middle East's finest dates 
                    with the world. Over time, our passion evolved into a mission to create a product that is not only delicious 
                    but also ethical. From the farms where our dates are grown to the hands that bottle our syrup, we prioritize 
                    quality and sustainability at every step.
                </p>
